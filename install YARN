curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -   (add the GPG key)
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
Now, it will do as  standard package manager can access and manage Yarn
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install yarn
yarn ––version  to check the version   


We can try to intsall yarn using npm if npm is installed otherwise you have to install npm first


sudo npm install yarn –g
